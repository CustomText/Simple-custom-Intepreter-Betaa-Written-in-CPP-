this is a simple interpreted language that I call 'Betaa', as the repository name suggests, it is written in c++.
The language includes simple things, like print, variables, simple functions without arguments, cin/prompt and if statements!
This project was one of my biggest interests for about 2 months, but I uploaded it to github only just now :D
The code is obviously good to try out, just plop it into your vs code environment (or any compatible c++ compiler), and code away!
the functionalities of this programming language are the following:

function hi
  var hi = "hi!"
  input <- hi
  if hi == "hi!"
    print "hey dude!"
  |
produce
print product.hi
